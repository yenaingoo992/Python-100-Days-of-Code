# 100 Days of Python Code Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of Python coding challenge! In this repository, I will be documenting and sharing my progress as I go through the 100 days of coding with Python. Each day, I will push a new Python project, challenge solution, or concept I learned. The goal is to improve my Python skills, tackle real-world coding problems, and stay consistent.

## About

The "100 Days of Python" is a coding challenge designed to help learners develop their Python skills by working on a series of tasks and projects over 100 days. Each day, I will explore different Python concepts, libraries, and tools, with the aim of becoming proficient in Python development.

## Challenge Breakdown

The challenge includes the following types of tasks:
- **Basic Python syntax and logic**
- **Data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, etc.)**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **APIs and Web Scraping**
- **Working with external libraries (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib)**
- **Automation scripts**
- **Mini-projects**
- **And much more!**

I will keep a record of each day's code in this repository.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yenaingoo992/Python-100-Days-of-Code.git

2. Navigate to the specific day's directory:
   ```bash
   cd day_x

3. Run the Python script for that day:
   ```bash
   python xxxx.py
